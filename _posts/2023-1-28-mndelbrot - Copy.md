## a describtion about my project

In the name of God

    I can consider Mandelbrat as one of the most exciting, enjoyable and beautiful challenges of my life. A different and artistic process in which we sought to discover different hidden beauties in every place of this wide map: a map whose different colors and designs could create a special beauty in every place.
    The beauty and color effects of the Mandelbrat map on the one hand and Sonic Pie and music production for me, who had no knowledge of musical notes, made the project more attractive so that we could create a work of art with programming.

    From the day I didn't intend to do the project and wanted not to do it until the day I finished it and was waiting for the presentation time to arrive, I experienced different situations every moment.
    An interesting experience in which I had to use my latest learning, complex numbers, and create beauty with complex number formulas.
    I owe the result to the training of our capable teacher, Mr. Emetadi, and the help, cooperation, and troubleshooting of the teachers, and the help of my dear friends.
    The use of different sites to discover the relationships of capabilities and the cooperation of my friends became the reason for this project to come to fruition.
